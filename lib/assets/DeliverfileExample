# Dynamic generation of the ipa file
# I'm using Shenzhen by Mattt, but you can use any build tool you want
# Remove the whole block if you do not want to upload an ipa file
ipa do
    # Add any code you want, like incrementing the build 
    # number or changing the app identifier

    # system("ipa build") # build your project using Shenzhen
    "./[[APP_NAME]].ipa" # Tell 'Deliver' where it can find the finished ipa file
end

# ipa "./latest.ipa" # this can be used, if you prefer manually building the ipa file

# unit_tests do
#   system("xctool test")
