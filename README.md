###### Easily sync your certificates and profiles across your team using git

A new approach to code signing: Share one code signing identity across your development team to simplify your codesigning setup.

## Why match?

Before starting to use `match`, make sure to read the [codesigning.guide](https://codesigning.guide) 

> When deploying an app to the App Store, beta testing service or even installing it on a device, most development teams have separate code signing identities for every member. This results in dozens of profiles including a lot of duplicates.

> You have to manually renew and download the latest provisioning profiles every time we add a new device or a certificate expires. Additionally you have to spend a lot of time when setting up a new machine. 

**A new approach**

> What if there was a central place where your code signing identity and profiles are kept, so anyone in the team can access them during the build process?

### Why not let Xcode handle all this?

- You have full control over what happens
- You have access to all the certificates and profiles, which are all securely stored in git
- You share one code signing identity across the team to have less certificates and profiles
- Xcode sometimes revokes your certificates
- It just worksâ„¢

## Installation

```
sudo gem install match
```

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

## Usage

### Setup

Create a new private git repo and run the following in your project folder

```
match init
```

You'll be asked to enter the URL to your git repo. This can be either a `https://` or a `git://` URL. `match init` won't read or modify your certificates or profiles.

This will create a `Matchfile` in your current directory (or in your `./fastlane/` folder). Example content:
```ruby
git_url "https://github.com/fastlane/certificates"

app_identifier "tools.fastlane.app" 
username "user@fastlane.tools"
```

### Run

Before running `match` the first time, you should consider clearing your existing profiles and certificates using the [match nuke command](#nuke).

After running `match init` you can run the following to generate new certificates and profiles:

```
match appstore
```
```
match development
```

This will create a new certificate and provisioning profile (if required) and store them in your git repo. If you previously ran `match` it will automatically install the existing profiles from the git repo.

For a list of all available options run

```
match --help
```

#### fastlane

Add `match` to your `Fastfile` (part of [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools))

```ruby
match(type: "appstore")

match(git_url: "https://github.com/fastlane/certificates", 
      type: "development")

match(git_url: "https://github.com/fastlane/certificates", 
      type: "adhoc", 
      app_identifier: "tools.fastlane.app")

# `match` should be called before building the app
gym
...
```

### Setup Xcode project

To make sure Xcode is using the right provisioning profile for each target, don't use the `Automatic` feature for the profile selection.

`match` automatically pre-fills environment variables with the UUIDs of the correct provisioning profiles, ready to be used in your Xcode project. 

<img src="assets/UDIDPrint.png" width="700" />

Open your target settings, open the dropdown for `Provisioning Profile` and select `Other`:

```
$(sigh_tools.fastlane.app_development)
```

<img src="assets/XcodeProjectSettings.png" width="700" />

Additionally it is recommended to disable the `Fix Issue` button using the [FixCode Xcode Plugin](https://github.com/neonichu/FixCode).

### Install profiles on a new computer

To install all certificates and provisioning profiles on a new machine, just run

```
match bootstrap
```

Note: If you run the above command in the project directory containing the `Matchfile`, you won't be asked for the `git_url`, otherwise you can also pass it using

```
match bootstrap --git_url https://github.com/fastlane/certificates
```

### Nuke

If you never really cared about code signing and have a messy Apple Developer account with a lot of invalid, expired or Xcode managed profiles/certificates, you can use the `match nuke` command.

To revoke all certificates and provisioning profiles for a specific environment.

```sh
match nuke development
match nuke adhoc
match nuke appstore
```

You'll have to confirm a list of profiles / certificates that will be deleted.
