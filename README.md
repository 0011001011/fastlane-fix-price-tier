Deliver - Continuous Deployment for iOS
============

[ ![Codeship Status for KrauseFx/deliver](https://codeship.io/projects/685c3d40-39e2-0132-238b-56fe17215915/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.io/projects/42273)

Updating your iOS app should not be painful and time consuming. Automate the 
whole process to start with Continuous Deployment.

# Features
- Upload hundreds of screenshots with different languages from different devices
- Upload a new ipa file to iTunesConnect without Xcode
- Update app metadata
- Easily implement a real Continuous Deployment process
- Store the configuration in git to easily deploy from **any** computer, including your Continuous Integration server (e.g. Jenkins)

# Installation

    $ sudo gem install deliver

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

Install phantomjs (this is needed to control the iTunesConnect frontend)

    brew install phantomjs

If you don't have homebrew installed already, do it here: http://brew.sh/

# Quick Start


The guide will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunesConnect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```deliver init```
- When your app is already in the AppStore: ```y```
 - Enter your iTunesConnect credentials
 - Enter your app identifier
 - Enjoy a good drink, while the computer does all the work for you
- When it's a new app: ```n```

From now on, you can run ```deliver``` to deploy a new update, or just upload new app metadata and screenshots.

### Customize the ```Deliverfile```
Open the ```Deliverfile``` using a text editor and customize it even further. Take a look at the following settings:

- ```ipa```: You can either pass a static path to an ipa file, or add your custom build script.
- ```beta_ipa```: If you only want to distribute a beta build to your testers.
- ```unit_tests```: Uncomment the code to run tests using *xctool*.

# Usage

## Using a ```Deliverfile``` (recommended)
Why should you have to remember complicated commands and parameters?

Store your configuration in a text file to easily deploy from any computer.

Run ```deliver init``` to create a new ```Deliverfile```. You can either let the wizard generate a file based on the metadata from iTunesConnect or create one from a template.

Here are a few example files:
#### Upload all screenshots to iTunesConnect
```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1"
screenshots_path "./screenshots"
```
The screenshots folder must include one subfolder per language (see Available language codes)

#### Distribute an ipa file to your TestFlight beta testers
```ruby
beta_ipa "./latest.ipa"
```

#### Upload a new ipa file to the AppStore with a changelog to iTunesConnect
This will submit a new update to Apple
```ruby
ipa "./latest.ipa"
changelog({
    "en-US" => "This update adds cool new features",
    "de-DE" => "Dieses Update ist super"
})
```


#### Implement blocks to run unit tests
```ruby
unit_tests do
    system("xctool test")
end

success do
    notifier = Slack::Notifier.new("SlackTeam", "SlackToken")
    notifier.ping "Successfully deployed new version"
end

error do |exception|
    # custom exception handling here
    raise "Something went wrong: #{exception}"    
end
```
For this example I used https://github.com/stevenosloan/slack-notifier


#### Set a default language if you are lucky enough to only maintain one language
```ruby
default_language "en-US"
version "1.2"

title "Only English Title"
```
If you do not pass an ipa file, you have to specify the app version you want to edit.

#### Update the app's keywords
```ruby
default_language "de-DE"
version "1.2"

keywords ["keyword1", "something", "else"]
```

#### Read content from somewhere external (file, web service, ...)
```ruby
description({
    "en-US" => File.read("changelog-en.txt")
    "de-DE" => open("http://example.com/latest-changelog.txt").read
})
```

#### Build and sign the app using Shenzhen (https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen)
```ruby
ipa do
    # Add any code you want, like incrementing the build 
    # number or changing the app identifier
  
    system("ipa build") # build your project using Shenzhen
    "./AppName.ipa" # Tell 'Deliver' where it can find the finished ipa file
end
```

#### Defining which languages your app supports
```ruby
supported_languages ["de-DE", "en-US", "en-CA", "it-IT"]
```
This will take care of creating the locales, if they don't already exist.

##### What is the ```Deliverfile```
As you can see, the ```Deliverfile``` is a normal Ruby file, which is executed when
running a deployment. Therefore it's possible to fully customise the behaviour
on a deployment. 

**Some examples:**

- Run your own unit tests or integration tests before a deploy (recommended)
- Ask the script user for a changelog
- Deploy a new version just by starting a Jenkins job
- Post the deployment status on Slack
- Upload the latest screenshots on your server
- Many more things, be creative and let me know :)
    
## Using the CLI (not yet finished)
The documentation will be updated, once this is implemented

## Using the exposed Ruby classes
Some examples
```ruby
app = Deliver::App.new(apple_id)

app.get_app_status # => Waiting for Review
app.create_new_version!("1.4")
app.metadata.update_title({ "en-US" => "iPhone App Title" })
app.metadata.set_all_screenshots_from_path("./screenshots")
app.upload_metadata!
app.submit_for_review!

Deliver::ItunesSearchApi.fetch_by_identifier("net.sunapps.9") # => Fetches public metadata
```
This project is well documented, check it out here: http://www.rubydoc.info/github/KrauseFx/deliver/frames


## Credentials

### Use the Keychain
The first time you use *Deliver* you have to enter your iTunesConnect 
credentials. They will be stored in the Keychain. 

If you decide to remove your
credentials from the Keychain, just open the *Keychain Access*, select 
*All Items* and search for 'itunesconnect.apple.com'.

### Use environment variables
You can use the following environment variables:

    DELIVER_USER
    DELIVER_PASSWORD
    
### Implement something custom to fit your needs
Take a look at *Using the exposed Ruby classes. You


# Can I trust *Deliver*? 
###How does this thing even work? Is magic involved? ðŸŽ©###

*Deliver* is fully open source, you can take a look at it. It will only modify the content you want to modify using the ```Deliverfile```. Your password will be stored in the Mac OS X keychain, but can also be passed using environment variables.

*Deliver* uses the following techniques under the hood:

- The iTMSTransporter tool is used to fetch the latest app metadata from iTunesConnect and upload the updated app metadata back to Apple. iTMSTransporter is a command line tool provided by Apple.
- With the iTMSTransporter you can not create new version on iTunesConnect or actually publish the newly uploaded ipa file. This is why there is some browser scripting involved, using Capybara (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and Poltergeist (https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist)
- The iTunes search API to find missing information about a certain app, like the *apple_id* when you only pass the *bundle_identifier*. 

# Tips
## Available language codes
```ruby
["da-DK", "de-DE", "el-GR", "en-AU", "en-CA", "en-GB", "en-US", "es-ES", "es-MX", "fi-FI", "fr-CA", "fr-FR", "id-ID", "it-IT", "ja-JP", "ko-KR", "ms-MY", "nl-NL", "no-NO", "pt-BR", "pt-PT", "ru-RU", "sv-SE", "th-TH", "tr-TR", "vi-VI", "cmn-Hans", "zh_CN", "cmn-Hant"]
