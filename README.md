Updating your iOS app should not be painful and time consuming. Automate the 
whole process to start with Continuous Deployment.

```Deliver``` **can upload ipa files, app screenshots and more to the iTunes Connect backend**, which means, you can deploy new iPhone app updates just by using one command.

# Features
- Upload hundreds of screenshots with different languages from different devices
- Upload a new ipa file to iTunes Connect without Xcode from any computer
- Update app metadata
- Easily implement a real Continuous Deployment process
- Store the configuration in git to easily deploy from **any** computer, including your Continuous Integration server (e.g. Jenkins)
- Get a PDF preview of the fetched metadata before uploading the app metadata and screenshots to Apple: [Example Preview](https://github.com/krausefx/deliver/blob/master/assets/PDFExample.png?raw=1) (Yes, those are screenshots taken for all screen sizes)
- Automatically create new screenshots with [Snapshot](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot)

# Installation

Install the gem

    sudo gem install deliver

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

Install phantomjs (this is needed to control the iTunes Connect frontend)

    brew update && brew install phantomjs

If you don't already have homebrew installed, [install it here](http://brew.sh/).

To create new screenshots automatically, check out my other open source project [Snapshot](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot).

# Quick Start


The guide will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```deliver init```
- When your app is already in the App Store: ```y```
 - Enter your iTunes Connect credentials
 - Enter your app identifier
 - Enjoy a good drink, while the computer does all the work for you
- When it's a new app: ```n```

Copy your screenshots into the ```deliver/screenshots/[language]``` folders (see [Available language codes](#available-language-codes))

From now on, you can run ```deliver``` to deploy a new update, or just upload new app metadata and screenshots.

### Customize the ```Deliverfile```
Open the ```Deliverfile``` using a text editor and customize it even further. Take a look at the following settings:

- ```ipa```: You can either pass a static path to an ipa file, or add your custom build script.
- ```unit_tests```: Uncomment the code to run tests. (e.g. using [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool))

# Usage

Why should you have to remember complicated commands and parameters?

Store your configuration in a text file to easily deploy from any computer.

Run ```deliver init``` to create a new ```Deliverfile```. You can either let the wizard generate a file based on the metadata from iTunes Connect or create one from a template.

Once you created your configuration, just run ```deliver```.

Here are a few example files:
#### Upload screenshots to iTunes Connect
```ruby
app_identifier "net.sunapps.1"
version "1.1"

screenshots_path "./screenshots"
```
The screenshots folder must include one subfolder per language (see [Available language codes](#available-language-codes)).

The screenshots are ordered alphabetically. The best way to sort them is to prepend a number before the actual screenshot name.

To let the computer create the screenshots for you, checkout [this section of the README](#automatically-create-screenshots).

If you want to have the screenshots inside a device frame, with a background and a fancy label on top, you can use [Sketch to App Store](http://sketchtoappstore.com/).

#### Upload a new ipa file with a changelog to the App Store
This will submit a new update to Apple
```ruby
ipa "./latest.ipa"
changelog({
    "en-US" => "This update adds cool new features",
    "de-DE" => "Dieses Update ist super"
})
```
If you wish to skip automated submission to review you can provide `--skip-deploy` option when calling `deliver`. This will upload the ipa file and app metadata, but will not submit the app for review.

#### Upload a new ipa for TestFlight beta testers

In order to upload an `.ipa` file for Apple TestFlight you need to specify `beta_ipa` path in your `Deliverfile`

```ruby
beta_ipa "./latest.ipa"
```

and provide `--beta` option when calling `deliver`.

#### Implement blocks to run unit tests
```ruby
unit_tests do
    system("xctool test")
end

success do
    notifier = Slack::Notifier.new("SlackTeam", "SlackToken")
    notifier.ping "Successfully deployed new version"
end

error do |exception|
    # custom exception handling here
    raise "Something went wrong: #{exception}"    
end
```
For this example I used [slack-notifier](https://github.com/stevenosloan/slack-notifier).


#### Set a default language if you are lucky enough to only maintain one language
```ruby
default_language "en-US"
version "1.2"

title "Only English Title"
```
If you do not pass an ipa file, you have to specify the app version you want to edit.

#### Update the app's keywords
```ruby
default_language "de-DE"
version "1.2"

keywords ["keyword1", "something", "else"]
```

#### Read content from somewhere external (file, web service, ...)
```ruby
description({
    "en-US" => File.read("description-en.txt")
    "de-DE" => open("http://example.com/app_description.txt").read
})
```

#### Build and sign the app
I'm using [Shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen), but you can use any build tool or custom scripts.
```ruby
ipa do
    # Add any code you want, like incrementing the build 
    # number or changing the app identifier
  
    system("ipa build") # build your project using Shenzhen
    "./AppName.ipa" # Tell 'Deliver' where it can find the finished ipa file
end
```

#### Hide the iTunes Transporter log
By default, the transporter log is shown, to be fully transparent. If you prefer to hide it, you can use the following option in your ```Deliverfile``` to disable it for both the upload and the download of metadata:
```ruby
hide_transporter_output
```

##### What is the ```Deliverfile```?
As you can see, the ```Deliverfile``` is a normal Ruby file, which is executed when
running a deployment. Therefore it's possible to fully customise the behaviour
on a deployment. 

All available commands with a short description can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver/wiki/All-available-commands-of-the-Deliverfile).

**Some examples:**

- Run your own unit tests or integration tests before a deploy (recommended)
- Ask the script user for a changelog
- Deploy a new version just by starting a Jenkins job
- Post the deployment status on Slack
- Upload the latest screenshots on your server
- Many more things, be creative and let me know :)
    
#### Use the exposed Ruby classes
Some examples:
```ruby
require 'deliver'

app = Deliver::App.new(app_identifier: 'at.felixkrause.app')

app.get_app_status # => Waiting for Review
app.create_new_version!("1.4")
app.metadata.update_title({ "en-US" => "iPhone App Title" })
app.metadata.set_all_screenshots_from_path("./screenshots")
app.upload_metadata!
app.itc.submit_for_review!(app)

Deliver::ItunesSearchApi.fetch_by_identifier("net.sunapps.15") # => Fetches public metadata
```
This project is well documented, check it out on [Rubydoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/KrauseFx/deliver/frames).


# Credentials
The used username (Apple ID) will be stored in the ```Deliverfile``` by default. When you run ```deliver``` for the first time on another computer, you will only be asked for the password.

Therefore it is easy to switch between projects, without needing to logout and login again.

## Use the Keychain
The first time you use *Deliver* you have to enter your iTunes Connect 
credentials. They will be stored in the Keychain. 

If you decide to remove your
credentials from the Keychain, just open the *Keychain Access*, select 
*All Items* and search for 'deliver'.

## Use environment variables
You can use the following environment variables to use a specific account instead of the one stored in the keychain.
This is especially important if you have more than one iTunes Connect account in your keychain:

    DELIVER_USER
    DELIVER_PASSWORD
    
## Implement your custom solution
Take a look at [Using the exposed Ruby classes](#use-the-exposed-ruby-classes).

# Can I trust *Deliver*? 
###How does this thing even work? Is magic involved? ðŸŽ©###

```Deliver``` is fully open source, you can take a look at it. It will only modify the content you want to modify using the ```Deliverfile```. Your password will be stored in the Mac OS X keychain, but can also be passed using environment variables.

Before actually uploading anything to iTunes, ```Deliver``` will generate a [PDF summary](https://github.com/krausefx/deliver/blob/master/assets/PDFExample.png?raw=1) of the collected data. 

```Deliver``` uses the following techniques under the hood:

- The iTMSTransporter tool is used to fetch the latest app metadata from iTunes Connect and upload the updated app metadata back to Apple. It is also used to upload the ipa file. iTMSTransporter is a command line tool provided by Apple.
- With the iTMSTransporter you cannot create new version on iTunes Connect or actually publish the newly uploaded ipa file. This is why there is some browser scripting involved, using [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [Poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist).
- The iTunes search API to find missing information about a certain app, like the *apple_id* when you only pass the *bundle_identifier*.

## Available language codes
```ruby
["da-DK", "de-DE", "el-GR", "en-AU", "en-CA", "en-GB", "en-US", "es-ES", "es-MX", "fi-FI", "fr-CA", "fr-FR", "id-ID", "it-IT", "ja-JP", "ko-KR", "ms-MY", "nl-NL", "no-NO", "pt-BR", "pt-PT", "ru-RU", "sv-SE", "th-TH", "tr-TR", "vi-VI", "cmn-Hans", "zh_CN", "cmn-Hant"]
```

## Use a clean status bar
You can use [SimulatorStatusMagic](https://github.com/shinydevelopment/SimulatorStatusMagic) to clean up the status bar.

## Automatically create screenshots

You can easily create screenshots completely automatically in the background using [```snapshot```](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot), the little brother of ```deliver```.

**Getting started:**

- Run ```snapshot init``` in your project folder
- You can edit the new ```snapshot.js``` file with your UI Automation code
- Run ```snapshot``` to test if the screenshots work as expected
- Remove the line ```screenshots_path``` from your ```Deliverfile``` to automatically create new screenshots for each deployment. 

From now on, when you start ```deliver```, it will first create the new screenshots for you, which then will be uploaded to iTunes Connect.

More information about ```snapshot``` can be found on the [Snapshot GitHub page](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot).

## Jenkins integration
Depending on how you set up your Jenkins instance, there might be problems with the ```phantomjs``` dependency.

I've been using [Jenkins App](https://github.com/stisti/jenkins-app) for a long time, where ```Deliver``` works just fine. 

You should not deploy a new App Store update after every commit, since you still have to wait for your review. Instead I recommend using Git Tags, or custom triggers to deploy a new update. 

## Editing the ```Deliverfile```
Change syntax highlighting to *Ruby*.
