# What's spaceship?

spaceship is a Ruby library that exposes the Apple Developer Center API. Itâ€™s super fast, well tested and supports all of the operations you can do via the browser. Scripting your Developer Center workflow has never been easier!

Up until now, the [fastlane tools](https://fastlane.tools) used web scraping to interact with Apple's web services. With spaceship it is possible to directly access the underlying APIs using a simple HTTP client only.

Using spaceship, the execution time of [sigh](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh) was reduced from over 1 minute to less than 5 seconds.

spaceship uses a combination of 3 different API endpoints, used by the Apple Developer Portal and Xcode. As no API offers everything we need, spaceship combines all APIs for you. [More details about the APIs](#technical-details).

More details about why spaceship is useful on [spaceship.airforce](https://spaceship.airforce).

> No matter how many apps or profiles you have, spaceship **can** handle your scale.

Enough words, here is some code:

```ruby
Spaceship.login
 
# Create a new app
app = Spaceship.app.create!(bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app", name: "Spaceship App")
 
# Use an existing certificate
cert = Spaceship.certificate.production.all.first
 
# Create a new provisioning profile
profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.app_store.create!(bundle_id: app.bundle_id,
                                                         certificate: cert)
 
# Print the name and download the new profile
puts "Created Profile " + profile.name
profile.download
```

## Speed

How fast are tools using `spaceship` compared to web scraping? 

![assets/SpaceshipRecording.gif](assets/SpaceshipRecording.gif)

# Installation

    sudo gem install spaceship

# Usage

To quickly play around with `spaceship` launch `irb` in your terminal and execute `require "spaceship"`. 

## Login

```ruby
Spaceship.login("felix@krausefx.com", "password")

Spaceship.select_team # call this method to let the user select a team
```

## Apps

```ruby
# Fetch all available apps
all_apps = Spaceship.app.all

# Find a specific app based on the bundle identifier
app = Spaceship.app.find("com.krausefx.app")

# Show the names of all your apps
Spaceship.app.all.each do |app|
  puts app.name
end

# Create a new app
app = Spaceship.app.create!(bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app_name", name: "fastlane App")
```

## Certificates

```ruby
# Fetch all available certificates (includes signing and push profiles)
certificates = Spaceship.certificate.all
```

### Code Signing Certificates

```ruby
# Production identities
prod_certs = Spaceship.certificate.production.all

# Development identities
dev_certs = Spaceship.certificate.development.all

# Download a certificate
cert_content = prod_certs.first.download
```

### Push Certificates
```ruby
# Production push profiles
prod_push_certs = Spaceship.certificate.production_push.all

# Development push profiles
dev_push_certs = Spaceship.certificate.development_push.all

# Download a push profile
cert_content = dev_push_certs.first.download
```

### Create a Certificate

```ruby
# Create a new certificate signing request
csr, pkey = Spaceship.certificate.create_certificate_signing_request

# Use the signing request to create a new distribution certificate
Spaceship.certificate.production.create!(csr: csr)

# Use the signing request to create a new push certificate
Spaceship.certificate.production_push.create!(csr: csr, bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app")
```

## Provisioning Profiles

### Receiving profiles

```ruby
##### Finding #####

# Get all available provisioning profiles
profiles = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.all

# Get all App Store profiles
profiles_appstore = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.app_store.all

# Get all AdHoc profiles
profiles_adhoc = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.ad_hoc.all

# Get all Development profiles
profiles_dev = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.development.all

# Fetch all profiles for a specific app identifier for the App Store
filtered_profiles = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.app_store.find_by_bundle_id("com.krausefx.app")

##### Downloading #####

# Download a profile
profile_content = profiles.first.download

# Download a specific profile as file
my_profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.app_store.find_by_bundle_id("com.krausefx.app")
File.write("output.mobileprovision", my_profile.download)
```

### Create a Provisioning Profile

```ruby
# Choose the certificate to use
cert = Spaceship.certificate.production.all.first

# Create a new provisioning profile with a default name
# The name of the new profile is "com.krausefx.app AppStore"
profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.app_store.create!(bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app",
                                                         certificate: cert)

# AdHoc Profiles will add all devices by default
profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.ad_hoc.create!(bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app",
                                                      certificate: cert,
                                                             name: "Profile Name")

# Store the new profile on the filesystem
File.write("NewProfile.mobileprovision", profile.download)
```

### Repair a broken provisioning profile

```ruby
# Select all 'Invalid' or 'Expired' provisioning profiles
broken_profiles = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.all.find_all do |profile| 
  (profile.status == "Invalid" or profile.status == "Expired")
end

# Iterate over all broken profiles and repair them
broken_profiles.each do |profile|
  profile.repair! # yes, that's all you need to repair a profile
end

# or to make the same thing, just more Ruby like:
Spaceship.provisioning_profile.all.find_all { |p| %w[Invalid Expired].include?p.status}.map(&:repair!)
```

## Devices

```ruby
all_devices = Spaceship.device.all

# Register a new device
Spaceship.device.create!(name: "Private iPhone 6", udid: "5814abb3...")
```

## Enterprise

```ruby
# Use the InHouse class to get all enterprise certificates
cert = Spaceship.certificate.in_house.all.first 

# Create a new InHouse Enterprise distribution profile
profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.in_house.create!(bundle_id: "com.krausefx.*",
                                                        certificate: cert)

# List all In-House Provisioning Profiles
profiles = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.in_house.all
```

## Multiple Spaceships

Sometimes one `spaceship` just isn't enough. That's why this library has its own Spaceship Launcher to launch and use multiple `spaceships` at the same time :rocket:

```ruby
# Launch 2 spaceships
spaceship1 = Spaceship::Launcher.new("felix@krausefx.com", "password")
spaceship2 = Spaceship::Launcher.new("stefan@spaceship.airforce", "password")

# Fetch all registered devices from spaceship1
devices = spaceship1.device.all

# Iterate over the list of available devices
# and register each device from the first account also on the second one
devices.each do |device|
  spaceship2.device.create!(name: device.name, udid: device.udid)
end
```

## More cool things you can do
```ruby
# Find a profile with a specific name
profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.development.all.find { |p| p.name == "Name" }

# Add all available devices to the profile
profile.devices = Spaceship.device.all

# Push the changes back to the Apple Developer Portal
profile.update!

# Get the currently used team_id
Spaceship.client.team_id

# We generally don't want to be destructive, but you can also delete things
# This method might fail for various reasons, e.g. app is already in the store
app = Spaceship.app.find("com.krausefx.app")
app.delete!
```

## Spaceship in use

The beta version of [sigh](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh) is already using `spaceship` to communicate with Apple's web services. You can see all relevant source code in [runner.rb](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh/blob/feature/spaceship/lib/sigh/spaceship/runner.rb).

## Full Documentation

The detailed documentation of all available classes is available on [RubyDoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/fastlane/spaceship/frames).

## Example Data

Some unnecessary information was removed, check out [provisioning_profile.rb](https://github.com/KrauseFx/spaceship/blob/master/lib/spaceship/provisioning_profile.rb) for all available attributes.

The example data below is a provisioning profile, containing a device, certificate and app. 

```
#<Spaceship::ProvisioningProfile::AdHoc 
  @devices=[
    #<Spaceship::Device 
      @id="5YTNZ5A9AA", 
      @name="Felix iPhone 6", 
      @udid="39d2cab02642dc2bfdbbff4c0cb0e50c8632faaa"
    >,  ...], 
  @certificates=[
    #<Spaceship::Certificate::Production 
      @id="LHNT9C2AAA", 
      @name="iOS Distribution", 
      @expires=#<DateTime: 2016-02-10T23:44:20>

# Technical Details

## HTTP Client

Up until now all [fastlane tools](https://fastlane.tools) used web scraping to interact with Apple's web services. `spaceship` uses a simple HTTP client only, resulting in much less overhead and extremely improved speed. 

Advantages of `spaceship` (HTTP client) over web scraping: 

- Blazing fast :rocket: 90% faster than previous methods
- No more overhead by loading images, HTML, JS and CSS files on each page load
- Great test coverage by stubbing server responses
- Resistant against design changes of the Apple Developer Portal
- Automatic re-trying of requests in case a timeout occurs
- By stubbing the `spaceship` objects it is possible to also implement tests for tools like [sigh](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh)

## API Endpoints

I won't go into too much technical details about the various API endpoints, but just to give you an idea:

- `https://idmsa.apple.com`: Used to authenticate to get a valid session
- `https://developerservices2.apple.com`: 
 - Get a detailed list of all available provisioning profiles
 - This API returns the devices, certificates and app for each of the profiles
 - Register new devices
- `https://developer.apple.com`: 
 - List all devices, certificates and apps
 - Create new certificates, provisioning profiles and apps
 - Delete certificates and apps
 - Repair provisioning profiles
 - Download provisioning profiles
 - Team selection

`spaceship` uses all those API points to offer this seamless experience.

## Magic involved

`spaceship` does a lot of magic to get everything working so neatly: 

- **Sensible Defaults**: You only have to provide the mandatory information (e.g. new provisioning profiles contain all devices by default)
- **Local Validation**: When pushing changes back to the Apple Dev Portal `spaceship` will make sure only valid data is sent to Apple (e.g. automatic repairing of provisioning profiles)
- **Various request/response types**: When working with the different API endpoints, `spaceship` has to deal with `JSON`, `XML`, `txt`, `plist` and sometimes even `HTML` responses and requests. 
- **Automatic Pagination**: Even if you have thousands of apps, profiles or certificates, `spaceship` **can** handle your scale. It was heavily tested by first using `spaceship` to create hundreds of profiles and then accessing them using `spaceship`.
- **Session, Cookie and CSRF token**: All the security aspects are handled by `spaceship`.
- **Profile Magic**: Create and upload code signing requests, all managed by `spaceship`
- **Multiple Spaceship**: You can launch multiple `spaceships` with different Apple accounts to do things like syncing the registered devices.
