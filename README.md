# Installation

Install the gem

    sudo gem install deliver

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

To create new screenshots automatically, check out my other open source project [snapshot](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot).

To upload builds to TestFlight check out [pilot](https://github.com/fastlane/pilot).

# Quick Start

The guide will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```deliver init```
- Enter your iTunes Connect credentials
- Enter your app identifier
- Enjoy a good drink, while the computer does all the work for you

From now on, you can run `deliver` to deploy a new update, or just upload new app metadata and screenshots.

# Usage

TODO

# Credentials

A detailed description about your credentials is available on a [separate repo](https://github.com/fastlane/CredentialsManager).

# Can I trust `deliver`? 
###How does this thing even work? Is magic involved? ðŸŽ©###

`deliver` is fully open source, you can take a look at its source files. It will only modify the content you want to modify using the ```Deliverfile```. Your password will be stored in the Mac OS X keychain, but can also be passed using environment variables. (More information available on [CredentialsManager](https://github.com/fastlane/CredentialsManager))

Before actually uploading anything to iTunes, ```deliver``` will generate a [HTML summary](https://github.com/krausefx/deliver/blob/master/assets/PDFExample.png?raw=1) of the collected data. 

```deliver``` uses the following techniques under the hood:

- The iTMSTransporter tool is used to upload the binary to iTunes Connect. iTMSTransporter is a command line tool provided by Apple.
- For all metadata related actions `deliver` uses [spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/spaceship)

## Automatically create screenshots

If you want to integrate ```deliver``` with ```snapshot```, check out [fastlane](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane)!

More information about ```snapshot``` can be found on the [Snapshot GitHub page](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot).

## Jenkins integration
Detailed instructions about how to set up `deliver` and `fastlane` in `Jenkins` can be found in the [fastlane README](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Jenkins.md).

## Firewall Issues

`deliver` uses the iTunes Transporter to upload metadata and binaries. In case you are behind a firewall, you can specify a different transporter protocol using

```
DELIVER_ITMSTRANSPORTER_ADDITIONAL_UPLOAD_PARAMETERS="-t DAV" deliver
```

## Limit
Apple has a limit of 150 binary uploads per day. 

## Editing the ```Deliverfile```
Change syntax highlighting to *Ruby*.
